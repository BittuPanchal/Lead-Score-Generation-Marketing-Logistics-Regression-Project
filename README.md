# Lead-Score-Generation-Marketing-Logistics-Regression-Project
Lead scoring is the process of assigning values, often in the form of numerical "points," to each lead you generate for the business.
You can score your leads based on multiple attributes, including the professional information they've submitted to you and how they've engaged with your website and brand across the internet. This process helps sales and marketing teams prioritize leads, respond to them appropriately, and increase the rate at which those leads become customers.

# In this project we have sevaral attributes to seggerigate the potential customers from population- 
1. Demographic Information - Are you only selling to people of a certain demographic, like parents of young children or CIOs? Ask demographic questions in the forms on your landing pages, and you can use your leads' answers to see how well they fit in with your target audience. One thing you can do with this information is remove outliers from your sales team's queue by subtracting points for people who fall into a category you don't sell to. For example, if you only sell to a certain geographic location, you might give a negative score to any lead who falls outside the proper city, state, zip code, country, and so on. If some of your form fields are optional (like a phone number, for instance), then you also might award extra points to leads who provide that option information anyway.
2. Company Information - If you're a B2B organization, are you more interested in selling to organizations of a certain size, type, or industry? Are you more interested in B2B organizations or B2C organizations? You can ask questions like these on your landing page forms, too, so you can give points to leads who fit in with your target audience and take points away from leads who aren't at all what you're looking for.
3. Online Behavior - How a lead interacts with your website can tell you a lot about how interested they are in buying from you. Take a look at your leads who eventually become customers: Which offers did they download? How many offers did they download? Which pages -- and how many pages -- did they visit on your site before becoming a customer? Both the number and types of forms and pages are important. You might give higher lead scores to leads who visited high-value pages (like pricing pages) or filled out high-value forms (like a demo request). Similarly, you might give higher scores to leads who had 30 page views on your site, as opposed to three. What about leads who have changed their behavior over time? If a lead has stopped visiting your website or downloading your offers, they may not be interested anymore. You might take points away from leads who've stopped engaging with your website after a certain period of time. How long -- 10 days, 30 days, 90 days -- depends on your typical sales cycle.
